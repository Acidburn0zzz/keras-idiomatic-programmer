# ResNet50 version 2
# Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf
# In this version, the BatchNormalization and ReLU activation are moved to be before the convolution in the bottleneck/projection blocks.
# In v1 and v1.5 they were after. 
# Note, this means that the ReLU that appeared after the add operation is now replaced as the ReLU proceeding the ending 1x1
# convolution in the block.
