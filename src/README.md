This directory's purpose is to meet Google Legal requirements for Googler's publishing. All source snippets (no matter how small)
must have the Google LLC copyright. Obviously, this will make our handbooks unreadadle!

The practice here is to make a copy of each code snippet, add a copyright and place it under the 'src' directory.
